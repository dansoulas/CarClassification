# CarClassification
Students from University of Wisconsin-Madison create a car classification model.

# Overview 
This project uses the Stanford dataset containing 16,185 images of cars that are used to train a classification model, the data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-cars-dataset). The approach uses transfer learning from the ResNet framework. Additional information on the steps taken can be found in the medium article written [here](https://medium.com/@soulas_56324/car-classification-model-75243d31b4c9).
